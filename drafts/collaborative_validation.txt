Collaborative Validation with SimpleStacks

This draft presents a use case with two SimpleStack objects to implement
a collaborative validation state in the workspaces.

This use case comes from the BRIQUES project (private CVS only).

Use case:
---------

The normal workflow in workspaces is::

  [create] -> (work) -> [copy-submit]

Our goal is two add a validation step before the submission in order to ask 
other WorkspaceMembers to review the document before submission::

  [create] -> (work) -> [submit_to_validation] -> (collaborative_validation) ->
  [auto_validate] -> (validated) -> [copy-submit] 

The `(collaborative_validation)` state is here to ask several
WorkspaceMembers to review the document before submission to the sections. Any
WorkspaceMember can choose to add other WorkspaceMembers to the list of
requested reviewers. Once they all agree to validate the document, the 
`[auto_validate]` transition is triggered and the document is ready for
submission.

Implementation
--------------

Let us zoom on the interesting part of the workflow::

  [submit_to_validation] -> (collaborative_validation) -> [auto_validate]
                                |              A
                                |              |
                                ---[validate]---

The `(collaborative_validation)` state holds two stacks respectively named 
`HasToValidate` and `DidValidate`. WorkspaceMembers can add other
WorkspaceMembers in the `HasToValidate` stack. People in this stack can then
access then choose to trigger the inplace `[validate]` actions that adds them to
the second stack. Each time the `[validate]` transitions is triggered, the two
stacks contents are compared. If they are equals, the `[auto_validate]`
transition is automatically triggered.
