[ This is an incomplete draft.]

The CPS workflows need to be improved to take into account common
usage patterns regarding work delegation.

Use cases
=========

1. Delegation of responsibility for an action.

   I have to review a document before doing 'accept' but for some
   reason I want to delegate this to someone else. The workflow
   should allow me to say "delegate to someone", in which case:

   - I get to chose one or several people or groups to which work
     is delegated.  These people are called the delegatees.

   - A choice must be made (by the system or by the user) to
     decide if I keep the possibility to do the action myself.

   - If the delegatees consist of several people, I must be able
     to specify that any person among them has to do the work, or
     all of them.

   - It must be possible for CPSSubscriptions to send a
     notification to the delegatees to tell them that they have a
     possible action.

   - Any delegatee now has the ability to 'accept' an action on
     the document.

   - It must be possible for CPSSubscriptions to inform all other
     delegatees and me that the action was performed.

2. Delegation with return back up the hierarchy after actions are
   done.

   I review and validate a document, and pass it to the next
   people in the workflow, but I want to check it back when all
   their work has been done.

Technical details
=================

A transition where an action delegation is allowed must have an
additional flag and parameters specifying what kind of delegation
is possible.

If a delegation is possible:

- A new transition "delegate to someone" is available with a guard
  for the role Delegatee,

- Creating a delegation is only allowed if the original action
  could have been followed (XXX does this work for time-dependent
  guards?).

If a delegation is in effect:

- There is a list of active delegatees, with a flag AND/OR (simple
  model), it must be stored in the object itself (XXX problems
  with multilingual documents),

- A delegatee must have the permission to view the document, given
  through the local role Delegatee that has the View permission.

- The guard for "delegate to someone" is changed to allow the
  delegatees to execute the transition, through the local role
  Delegatee,

- An automatic transition for the original action exists.

When a delegated action is done by a delegatee:

- The actor may have to be added to a list of people that acted on
  the document.

- If the actor is not the last, the actor is removed from the list
  of active delegatees and his local role Delegatee is removed.

- If the actor is the last (or if flag was OR), the original
  action must be followed.  This is done by following the delegated
  (XXX) transition, and then an automatic transition equivalent to
  the original action will be followed.

XXX

- Return up the hierarchy.

- Affect local role allowing document editing?

- Notify people who "did something" on the object.

- Notify people who had the possibility to do something (local
  role?).
