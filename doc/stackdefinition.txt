Stack Definition :
-------------------

A stack definition is an object stored within a state definition object
implementing an abstraction layer on a stack object instance.

A stack definition :

  - defines high level accessors and mutators on the stack object.

  - defines the policy of roles distributions for the stack elements stored
    within the stack using managed roles expressions. It includes as well a
    specific guard while the stack object doesn't contain elements yet.

  - defines the default policy for editing and viewing stack elements using
    guards. (note that a stack element do have its own guard that may
    override the default behavior from the stack definition).

It may be used as well without any roles policy if the purpose of the stack
is not to distribute local roles. (for instace : addind a stack of tasks
hooked on a given state)

---------------------------
Stack Definition Registry
---------------------------

If you need to implement a specific behavior you may register your own stack
definition.

You must implement the IWorkflowStackDefinition interface and usually you
will inherit from the base StackDefinition class in your child class which
is already implementing this interface.

You may use it like this :

  >>> from stackregistries import WorkflowStackDefRegsitry
  >>> from stackdefinition import StackDefinition
  >>>
  >>> class MyStackDefinition(StackDefinition):
  >>> ....# Here implementation
  >>> ....
  >>>
  >>> WorkflowStackDefRegistry.register(MyStackDefinition)
  >>>
