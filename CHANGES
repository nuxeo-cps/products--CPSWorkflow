Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- managed roles expressions on stack definition instead of the former hardcoded
properties

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
-
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Former local roles are now stored within the status of the object and not
  within the stack itself.
- No access to former local roles from the stack and stackdef
- wftool.getInfoFor() overriden since we want to use the StateChangeInfo from
  within CPSWorkflow.expression.
- API : wftool.getFormerLocalRoleMappingForStack()
- API : wftool.updateFormerLocalRoleMappingForStack()
- CPS State refactored
- Workflow API :
  - updateDelegateesLocalRolesFor() -> updateStackDefinitionsRoleMappingsFor()
