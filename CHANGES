Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- transition kws were not propagated to the stack definition _canManageStack
  method ; problem is not visible in CPSWorkflow as basic stack definitions do
  not use it.
- Fix for subtle 'Unauthorized' workflow bug triggered when trying to access
  object in 'after' script in destination(read 'sections') workflow,
  for example, for 'publish' action. The problem was that
  `updateRoleMappingsFor` method was called _after_ after_script.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Made some workflow exceptions more verbose
