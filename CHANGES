Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:

  within the stack itself.
- No access to former local roles from the stack and stackdef
- wftool.getInfoFor() overriden since we want to use the StateChangeInfo from
  within CPSWorkflow.expression.
- API : wftool.getFormerLocalRoleMappingForStack()
- API : wftool.updateFormerLocalRoleMappingForStack()
- CPS State refactored
- Workflow API :
  - updateDelegateesLocalRolesFor() -> updateStackDefinitionsRoleMappingsFor()
